## My choice of assignment: 
Option B - my Canada Covid Dashboard app

## Description
This is a dashboard app to plot the covid confirmed cases and deaths in provinces of Canada and Canada as a whole. The dashboard contains 3 major pages:  
- Comparison: user can compare the number of confirmed cases or deaths among provinces and Canada.  
- Canada/province statistics page: user can plot the number of confirmed case or/and deaths within a specific user-defined date range.
- Data download: user can preview and download the dataset used in this app.

## Features: 
I have showcased more than 3 required features in my app. These features have also been explained in my code.
0. Download dataset when the app is starting up
1. Navbar and tab feature
2. Collapsed menu feature
3. Slider feature
4. Radio button feature
5. Check box feature
6. Data download feature
7. Table display feature
8. Plot feature

## Dataset
The dataset is downloaded from the Canada government's [Covid-19: Outbreak update page](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html)

## Change Log
v1.1.0:
- removed the navbar tabs for each province
- added a drop menu to group the province in a single navbar tab
- added data download and display in a new navbar tab
- reordered the navbar tab to make more senses for users
